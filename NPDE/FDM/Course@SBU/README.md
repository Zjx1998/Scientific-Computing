## HW1: FTCS scheme for diffusion equation and diffusion-advection equation
## HW2: BTCS, Crank-Nicolson scheme for diffusion equation
## HW3: Lax-Wendroff, Beam-Warming, Leapfrog scheme for advection equation
The behaviour of the solution can be explained by high order PDE approximated by different schemes.
