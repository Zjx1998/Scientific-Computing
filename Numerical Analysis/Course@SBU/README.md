## HW1
Use finite difference to approximate the derivative. 
Trade-off between truncation error and rounding error, especially where the machine precision 1e-14 comes from.

## HW2
Nonlinear root finder.
The first step is always to analyze the problem to find a reasonable interval. Even hybrid methods need this step.

## HW3
Quadrature rules.
For special function, faster convergence rate may appear due to vanishing integration of higher derivative. High dimension quadrature and SciPy routines can be confusing.
